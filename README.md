# Diabetes Prediction Model

This repository contains a machine learning project focused on predicting the likelihood of diabetes based on various health metrics. The dataset used is the popular Pima Indians Diabetes dataset, which includes features such as glucose levels, blood pressure, skin thickness, and more.

## Overview

The project involves building and evaluating multiple machine learning models to predict diabetes outcomes. The key steps include data preprocessing, model training, and performance evaluation using various classifiers. The models implemented in this project are:

- **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) Classifier**
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM) with Polynomial Kernel**
- **Random Forest Classifier**

## Data Description

The dataset contains the following features:

1. **Pregnancies**: Number of pregnancies
2. **Glucose**: Plasma glucose concentration
3. **BloodPressure**: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
4. **SkinThickness**: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
5. **Insulin**: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
6. **BMI**: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
7. **DiabetesPedigreeFunction**: Diabetes pedigree function (a measure of diabetes risk)
8. **Age**: Age of the patient
9. **Outcome**: Whether or not the patient has diabetes (0 = No, 1 = Yes)

## Steps and Techniques

1. **Data Loading**: Load and explore the dataset.
2. **Data Visualization**: Generate various plots to understand data distributions and relationships.
3. **Data Preprocessing**: Handle feature scaling and train-test splitting.
4. **Model Training**: Train different classifiers including SGD, Logistic Regression, SVM, and Random Forest.
5. **Evaluation**: Assess model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC curve, and AUC.

## Results

- **Logistic Regression** achieved an accuracy of 77.6%.
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM) with Polynomial Kernel** achieved an accuracy of 84.5%.
- **Random Forest Classifier** achieved an accuracy of 77.6%.

The SVM model with a polynomial kernel demonstrated the best performance among the models tested.
